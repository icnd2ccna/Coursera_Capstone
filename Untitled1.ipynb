    "I will use a Data-Collisionss dataset for predicting incident severity churn. This is a historical car incident dataset where each row represents one incident. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights you can use immediately. Typically I make the focus of this analysis is to predict the severity which could happen from different whether.  \n",

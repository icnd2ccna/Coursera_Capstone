    "\n",
    "While Linear Regression is suited for estimating continuous values (e.g. estimating house price), it is not the best tool for predicting the class of an observed data point. In order to estimate the class of a data point, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the <b>most probable class</b> for that data point. For this, we use <b>Logistic Regression</b>.\n",

    "    As you know, <b>Linear regression</b> finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, <b>y</b>, to some predictors (independent variables $x_1$, $x_2$, etc.). For example, Simple linear regression assumes a function of the form:\n",

    "Logistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, <b>y</b>, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.\n",
